================

**Path to install:**<br>
Snippets can be stored under any packageâ€™s folder, but to keep it simple **clone** them to your **Packages** sublime folder.


## First: going to a Packages folder
**on mac:**

    cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/Packages

**on ubuntu:**

    cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
    p.s: Maybe you need to be sudo to clone then here on ubuntu.

## Second: Clone then

  git clone https://github.com/delimatorres/custom-snippets.git
