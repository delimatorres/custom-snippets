================

### Path to install:
Snippets can be stored under any packageâ€™s folder, but to keep it simple **clone** them to your **Packages** sublime folder.


#### 1. Going to a Packages folder.

**on mac:**

    cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/Packages

**on ubuntu:**

    cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
    p.s: Maybe you need to be sudo to clone then here on ubuntu.

#### 2. Clone it.

    git clone https://github.com/delimatorres/custom-snippets.git
